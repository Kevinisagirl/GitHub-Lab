# Using Git/GitHub

Read through this first before opening `GitHub-Lab.Rmd`.

## Forking the repo

One person from each group should fork the repository.

That person then needs to add the rest of the group as collaborators.

- `Settings -> Collaborators -> Add collaborator`

The group members will get an email which allows them to contribute to the repo.

## Issues

The issues tracker is a good way to manage bugs and features that need to be removed or added. Check out [this issue](https://github.com/acastrops/GitHub-Lab/issues/1)

## Working with git and GitHub

Open and follow along with the `GitHub-Lab.Rmd` file, using the repo created for your group.
